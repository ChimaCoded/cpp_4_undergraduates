## C++ Programming Curriculum for undergraduates

### Goals

- C++
  - Learn the fundamentals of programming
  - Be familiar to cpp & Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - Understand the concepts of OOP
    - Inheritance
    - Polymorphism
    - Information hiding
    - and else...
  - Study the polite ways to use cpp standard library (STL)
  - Learn various, useful programming techniques
    - GUI programming
    - Meta programming *using cpp template*
    

- Missing session
  - based on *Missing semester* course provided by MIT
  - Universities rarely cover extremely critical subject: *proficiency with tools*
  - Let's learn it together!!
